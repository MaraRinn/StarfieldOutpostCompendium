# Starfield Outpost Guide

This guide started off as my attempts to document a Vytinium Fuel Rod industrial hub based on [MattGyver's Advanced Nuclear Reactor Assembly Manual](https://www.mattgyver.com/store/starfield-advanced-reactor-assembly-manual). I ended up starting to build a calculator to help figure out what materials I needed to take with me to build each outpost, and wanted to document the best sites I found for those outposts. What you see here is a work in progress that will be added to over time.

## Overview

The contents are as follows:

- Industry From Scratch: how to start up an industrial base with nothing more than a cutter and some cash. For people who are starting NG+ you can even get started without a cutter, just get straight into the industry side from the moment you start the new game
- Advanced Nuclear Reactor Assembly Line: walks you through setting up an outpost network based on MattGyver's "Advanced Reactor Assembly Manual" plans including advice on optimising throughput for XP grinding based on resetting vendors every two days and attempting to sell all the Vytinium Fuel Rods produced
- Pharmaceutical Lab: three extra planets, set up a pharmaceutical lab to produce various medical aids such as amp, analgesic poultice, injector, and immobiliser

## Future Plans

- Detailed guide on how I locate outpost sites based on desired resources
- Some guides on laying out local production chains and local logistics, eg: separating import, local production and export storage, when it makes sense to use performing logistics manually, with limited cargo links, or with 6 cargo links allowed by Outpost Management when it isn't broken, when it makes sense to use transfer containers versus just using a collection of large storages
- Some thoughts on planning inter-planetary industry chains including specific optimisations I made to MattGyver's plans
