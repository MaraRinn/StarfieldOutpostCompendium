# Pharmaceutical Lab Products and Efficiency

One form of industry in Starfield is producing drugs. Some drugs are able to be produced at industrial scale, with input products scalable by number of extractors/greenhouses/animal houses, while other drugs will rely on availability of source materials such as Trauma Packs, Chasmbass Oil, or Caelumite (loot, vendor, anomaly sites respectively).

## The Lab

### Industrial Scale Aids

These are items produced entirely using player-created materials (Value Per Mass in brackets).

- [Snake Oil](https://inara.cz/starfield/item/393/) (1,250)ðŸŸ¡

From this list we'll focus on Analgesic Poultice, Repairing Immobiliser and Snake Oil. These items cover all the ailments we're likely to encounter, and have the highest value per mass which makes them good for generating income.

#### Analgesic Poultice

Sources for ingredients are a small selected list of domesticable fauna or flora. For more complete listing check Inara directly.

Producing Analgesic Poultice requires researching Medical Treatment 2 and each item crafted rewards 20XP. We can dispose of about 750 Analgesic Poultice every two days.

- Antibiotics (750)
  - Antimicrobial (750)
    - Kreet: Kreet Grazer (fauna)
    - Polvo: Bighorn (fauna)
    - Proycon III: Rotting Stinkroot (flora)
    - Proycon III: Coralheart (fauna)
  - Membrane (750)
    - Montara Luna: Dodo
    - Altair II: Canis Palm
    - Cassiopea IV-a: Moon Root
    - Eridani II: Tropical Maw Palm
    - Serpentis IV: Seahorse
- Bandages (750)
  - Fiber
    - Serpentis IV: Swamp Bottle Root (flora)
  - Sealant
    - Serpentis IV: Grabber (fauna)
- Heal Paste (750)
  - Analgesic (750)
    - Serpentis IV: Tuskfrog (fauna)
  - Membrane (750)
    - see above

My plan: produce Antimicrobial on Proycon III (already have an outpost for coolant), deliver those to Serpentis IV and produce Analgesic Poultice on Serpentis IV.

To produce one load of Analgesic Poultice requires:

- 750 Analgesic (0.5kg, 2 Storage - Solid - Large)
- 750 Antimicrobial (0.5kg, 2 Storage - Solid - Large)
- 750 Fiber (0.5kg, 2 Storage - Solid - Large)
- 1500 Membrane (0.5kg, 3 Storage - Solid - Large)
- 750 Sealant (0.5kg, 2 Storage - Solid - Large)

This plan requires producing a tad over 5 membrane per minute (32/h UT, 5 per real time minute which is 10 minutes in game). My current AHF produces 2 membrane per minute so I'll need 3 AHF (I usually build 2 large facilities for simplicity).

Start with establishing the production infrastructure. Ramping up to industrial production will come later.

## Home Kitchen

Since we're going to be cooking, may as well be cooking, too!

### Commercial Scale Meals

Here are some food & drink recipes that can be crafted using outpost production or easily sourced materials (ie: I would expect to find the bought ingredients in quantities of 10 or more per daily visit to a city like New Atlantis, Akila City or Neon).

Note that were "liquor" is required you should be able to use:

- Alien Liquor
- Bourbon
- Drink Pack: Vodka
- Drink Pack: Whiskey

Food:

- [Alien Pie](https://inara.cz/starfield/item/1150/)
- [Alien Sandwich](https://inara.cz/starfield/item/1051/)

### Industrial Scale Meals

Here are some food & drink recipes that can be crafted entirely from resources that are produced through industry. Those labelled "(sans-aromatic)" are recipes that do not require the aromatic resource since aromatic can be troublesome to produce industrially if you've committed to large scale vytinium fuel rod production.

Food:

- [Alien Jerky](https://inara.cz/starfield/item/29/) (sans-aromatic)
- [Alien Kebabs](https://inara.cz/starfield/item/1149/)

## Planet Plans

### Nice Outpost Starter

This is an advanced outpost that has a two-storey build, top floor is a glass-walled hab to let you see the scenery and will contain 3 crew stations. Bottom floor is a regular hab which will contain three beds. Later I'll look at adding dividers for privacy, though I may end up just having small habs hanging off for individual bedrooms.

- Four Wall Hab - Double
- Hab Round
- Hydroponic Hab Round
- Outpost Airlock
- 3 Crew Station
- 3 Bed 12

### Serpentis IV

This is the main lab, with production facilities and large solid storages for each component.

In general you need about 1 water extractor for each greenhouse and animal husbandry facility. Each animal husbandry facility in this installation requires fibre too. This means that for each animal husbandry facility there are 2 water extractors and 1 greenhouse producing fiber. Then you find that production rates never quite match up with consumption rates and suddenly five animal husbandry facilities require 10 fiber greenhouses and 10 water extractors, with a bit extra on top.

NB: The greenhouses and animal facilities can be replaced with industrial variants as part of *Advanced Reactor Assembly Line* - skip to the section on *Industrial Liquid Extractors*. Short version: buy Substrate Molecule Sieve from Clint/Outland/UC Exchange/Sieghart/Shepard's/The Trader, and replace 2 Greenhouse with 1 Greenhouse - Industrial. For the water extractors, you also want Veryl-Treated Manifold from the same vendors.

Design:

- 5 Wind Turbine - Advanced (25 power)
- 5 Animal Husbandry Facility (analgesic, membrane, sealant, spice, toxin)
- 12 Greenhouse (9 fiber, metabolic agent, nutrient, structural)
- 15 Extractor - Liquid (water)
- Storage - Liquid - Large (water)
- 11 Storage - Solid - Large (analgesic, antimicrobial, aromatic, biosuppressant, fiber, membrane, metabolic agent, sealant, sedative, structural, toxin)
- 3 Extractor - Gas (argon, benzene, chlorine)
- 4 Storage - Gas - Large (alkanes, argon, benzene, chlorine)
- Pharmaceutical Lab (analgesic poultice)

## Operation

From time to time, do a tour of the supply planets to pick up ingredients:

- Procyon III (antimicrobial, sedative)
- Alpha Andraste III (biosuppressant)
- Groombridge VIII-a/Hyla II (aromatic)
- Alpha Tirna VIII-c (alkanes)

Then cook up:

- Alien Stew
