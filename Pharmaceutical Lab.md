# Pharmaceutical Lab Products and Efficiency

One form of industry in Starfield is producing drugs. Some drugs are able to be produced at industrial scale, with input products scalable by number of extractors/greenhouses/animal houses, while other drugs will rely on availability of source materials such as Trauma Packs, Chasmbass Oil, or Caelumite (loot, vendor, anomaly sites respectively).

## Industrial Scale Aids

These are items produced entirely using player-created materials (Value Per Mass in brackets).

### Analgesic Poultice

Sources for ingredients are a small selected list of domesticable fauna or flora. For more complete listing check Inara directly.

Producing Analgesic Poultice requires researching Medical Treatment 2 and each item crafted rewards 20XP.

- Antibiotics (750)
  - Antimicrobial
    - Kreet: Kreet Grazer (fauna)
    - Polvo: Bighorn (fauna)
    - Proycon III: Rotting Stinkroot (flora)
    - Proycon III: Coralheart (fauna)
  - Membrane
    - Montara Luna: Dodo
    - Altair II: Canis Palm
    - Cassiopea IV-a: Moon Root
    - Eridani II: Tropical Maw Palm
    - Serpentis IV: Seahorse
- Bandages (400)
  - Fiber
    - Serpentis IV: Swamp Bottle Root (flora)
  - Sealant
    - Serpentis IV: Grabber (fauna)
- Heal Paste (800)
  - Analgesic
    - Serpentis IV: Tuskfrog (fauna)
  - Membrane
    - see above

My plan: produce Antimicrobial on Proycon III (already have an outpost for coolant), deliver those to Serpentis IV and produce Analgesic Poultice on Serpentis IV.

## Retail-Scale Aids

These are items whose manufacture requires dropped, manually acquired, or bought components.

The "star heart" line are generally based on Alien Genetic Material and Caelumite:

## Planet Plans

### Nice Outpost Starter

This is an advanced outpost that has a two-storey build, top floor is a glass-walled hab to let you see the scenery and will contain 3 crew stations. Bottom floor is a regular hab which will contain three beds. Later I'll look at adding dividers for privacy, though I may end up just having small habs hanging off for individual bedrooms.

Design:

- Landing Pad - Small
- Four Wall Hab - Double
- Hab Round
- Hydroponic Hab Round
- Outpost Airlock
- 3 Crew Station
- 3 Bed 10
- Mission Board
- Constellation Mission Board
- Self-Service Bounty Clearance
- Industrial Workbench
- Cooking Station
- Pharmaceutical Lab
- Weapon Workbench
- Spacesuit Workbench
- Research Lab

Bill of Materials:

- 52 Aluminium
- 12 Fiber
- 14 Iron
- 20 Lead
- 9 Nickel
- 16 Sealant
- 16 Structural

### Serpentis IV

Production facilities and large solid storages for each component:

  - membrane
  - fiber
  - sealant
  - analgesic
  - antimicrobial (from Procyon III)

In general you need about 1 water extractor for each greenhouse and animal husbandry facility. Each animal husbandry facility in this installation requires fibre too. This means that for each animal husbandry facility there are 2 water extractors and 1 greenhouse producing fiber. Then you find that production rates never quite match up with consumption rates and suddenly five animal husbandry facilities require 10 fiber greenhouses and 10 water extractors, with a bit extra on top.

Design:

- 5 Wind Turbine - Advanced (25 power)
- 5 Animal Husbandry Facility (analgesic, membrane, sealant, spice, toxin)
- 11 Greenhouse (9 fiber, structural, metabolic agent)
- 12 Extractor - Liquid (water)
- Storage - Liquid - Large (water)
- 7 Storage - Solid - Large (analgesic, fiber, membrane, metabolic agent, sealant, structural, toxin)

Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Adaptive Frame: 160
  - Isocentered Magnet: 10
  - Reactive Gauge: 48
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 257
  - Iron: 176
  - Nickel: 64
  - Sealant: 48
- Gas
  - Fluorine: 44

### Proycon III

I already have a base on Proycon III, this just expands on that installation.

Wind Turbine - Advanced produces 25 power. Sticking to "commercial" water extractors until I can put an outpost on Verne I (Planetary Habitation 2).

- Greenhouse - Industrial (antimicrobial)
- 2 Extractor - Liquid - Commercial (water)
- 1 Storage - Liquid - Large (water for greenhouse)
- 2 Storage - Solid - Large (antimicrobial)
- Wind Turbine - Advanced (25 power)

Bill of materials:

- 45 Adaptive Frame
- 57 Aluminium
- 6 Austentic Manifold
- 12 Fluorine
- 40 Iron
- 2 Isocentered Magnet
- 4 Molecular Sieve
- 16 Nickel
- 9 Sealant
- 2 Substrate Molecule Sieve
- 8 Titanium

### Alpha Andraste III

This base exists to extract two resources: Biosuppressant and Xenon. For the pharmaceuticals lab the only thing we care about is biosuppressant.

- 1 Extractor - Liquid (water)
- 1 Storage - Liquid - Large (water)
- Greenhouse (biosuppressant)
- 1 Storage - Solid - Large (biosuppressant)
- 1 Extractor - Gas (xenon)
- 1 Storage - Gas - Large (xenon)
- 1 Wind Turbine - Advanced (25 power)

### Commercial Scale Meals

Here are some food & drink recipes that can be crafted using outpost production or easily sourced materials (ie: I would expect to find the bought ingredients in quantities of 10 or more per daily visit to a city like New Atlantis, Akila City or Neon).

Note that were "liquor" is required you should be able to use:

- Alien Liquor
- Bourbon
- Drink Pack: Vodka
- Drink Pack: Whiskey

### Industrial Scale Meals

Here are some food & drink recipes that can be crafted entirely from resources that are produced through industry. Those labelled "(sans-aromatic)" are recipes that do not require the aromatic resource since aromatic can be troublesome to produce industrially if you've committed to large scale vytinium fuel rod production.
