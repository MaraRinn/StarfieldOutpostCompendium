These will be moved to Starfield Wiki as soon as possible.

Currently using [Inara](https://inara.cz/starfield/) for resource hunting.

### Planet Reporting Outpost

- Scan Booster - Military Grade (12 power)
  - 6 Aluminium
  - 2 Comm Relay
  - 1 Paramagnon Conductor
  - 1 Supercooled Magnet
- Solar Array: 4 Aluminium, 2 Beryllium, 3 Copper
- Wind Turbine: 3 NIckel, 2 Cobalt, 5 Aluminium
- Wind Turbine - Advanced: 2 Isocentered Magnet, 5 Aluminium
- Ballistic Turret: 4 Iron, 2 Beryllium, 3 Lead

Note that the scan booster only boosts your scanner while inside the permieter of the outpost. One option is to open the scanner while inside the outpost and do your entire exploration with the scanner view. This gets tedious.

Maybe one day Scan Boosters will function as expected (ie: boosting scanner ability for the entire planet) but that's not today.
