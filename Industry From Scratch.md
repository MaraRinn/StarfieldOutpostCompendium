# Industry from Scratch

New Game, New You? Here's how to bootstrap your industry. Start off with a handful of Tungsten, building out basic resources and low tier manufactured goods. At the completion of this guide you'll be able to construct "tier 1" goods (the ones made by [Simple Fabricator](https://inara.cz/starfield/outpost-module/1206/)). The process is entirely based on picking stuff up from each outpost and bringing it back to Bessel III-b for the moment. Cargo Links for some routes will be added right at the end.

After that we'll proceed to producing Reactors in *Advanced Reactor Assembly Line*, or you can branch out into pharmaceuticals with *Pharmaceutical Lab*.

## Preparation

Starting from the beginning of the game, I will typically go through the Constellation quest line to pick up Andreja & Barrett, then the "Into the Unknown" quest that will take us to Procyon III eventually (the third outpost built in this guide). Then head to New Atlantis and procure:

- 28 Tungsten
- 38 Copper

Many outposts here will use small landing pads. If you want to get through the whole guide using larger ships, I'll leave it to you to adjust the build materials. To place a large landing pad instead of small you'll need to add:

- 18 Adaptive Frame
- 2 Beryllium
- 10 Iron
- 2 Zero Wire

## Bessel III-b Al/Fe/Ni/Co

Start with Bessel III-b, basic extraction site. Produce Isocentered Magnet and Adaptive Frame from that material.

This site can be boot-strapped with 8 tungsten (bought from eg: Jemison Mercantile) by building the industrial workbench from gathered materials, then continuing to produce components (isocentered magnets for the turbines, adaptive frame for the storage) from harvested materials.

Be aware that one local hour on Bessel III-b is a couple of days UT. One local day is 58 days UT. To get the landing site into daylight from the start of the game takes a month.

Once this outpost is established, start building out storage with each visit.

Design:

- Industrial Workbench
- 4 Wind Turbine - Advanced (6 power)
- 4 Extractor - Solid (aluminum, cobalt, iron, nickel)
- 4 Storage - Solid - Large (aluminum, cobalt, iron, nickel)
- Landing Pad - Small

- Adaptive Frame: 40
- Aluminum: 112
- Iron: 123
- Isocentered Magnet: 8
- Tungsten: 8

## Alpha Tirna VIII-c (Dy, Pb, Ta, Ti, W, Alkanes)

Power and water are an issue on this planet. Solar Arrays will produce 6 power while Wind Turbines produce 3. Water is only available as vapour. The main minerals of interest here are Titanium for warehouses and Tungsten for extractors. Tungsten is available locally, copper is not. In the early game there's a bit of chicken-and-egg going on between sourcing copper from Procyon III versus the tungsten to build extractors from this outpost.

To get around buying copper, consider gathering enough copper from Procyon III to build enough infrastructure to start extracting tungsten here, then build the copper extractor on Procyon III, then with enough copper come back to finish this outpost.

Design:

- 1 Landing Pad - Small
- 3 Solar Dome (12 power)

  - Adaptive Frame: 60
  - Tau Grade Rheostat: 6
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 125
  - Copper: 23
  - Iron: 145
  - Nickel: 4
  - Tungsten: 26

Location:

Check Brahmiluff's location from [8-in-one Resources Tirna VIII-c Outpost Location in Starfield!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCjAUcrqYGs). Here's the swamp site on the planet resource map with higher level Scanning skill:

![swamp site](images/tirna-viii-c-location-map-swamp-site.jpg)

Unfortunately this is one of those "keep trying till it works" scenarios. My images for whatever reason look nothing like Brahmiluff's - different resolution, different zoom level, completely different look to the splotches of colour. There's no convenient border nearby, the surrounding pixels are all swamp. There's a confluence of savanna, hills and swamp to the west but there's no convenient outpost location there.

If you find a better location that's easier to pick up the first time, please raise an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaraRinn/StarfieldOutpostCompendium).

## Procyon III (Cu, Sealant)

[Procyon III](https://inara.cz/starfield/starsystem/101/#area1624) is one of several convenient sources of **Ionic Liquid**, along with Copper, Fluorine, Tetrafluoride, Water, Antimicrobial, Sealant, and Fiber. All the materials should be available if you select a site in a region rich with Ionic Liquids (bright green patches on the map).

We'll start off with extracting copper to drive industry at Bessel III-b.

Design:

- Landing Pad - Small
- Industrial Workbench
- Wind Turbine - Advanced (25 power)
- Extractor - Solid (copper)
- 2 Storage - Solid - Large (copper, sealant)
- Extractor - Liquid (water)
- Storage - Liquid - Large (water)
- Greenhouse (sealant)

Bill of Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Adaptive Frame: 35
  - Isocentered Magnet: 2
  - Reactive Gauge: 3 (built on-site using copper extracted locally)
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 78 (+6 for reactive gauge)
  - Iron: 71
  - Nickel: 20
  - Sealant: 3 (cold cave nettle, frozen plains)
  - Tungsten: 2
- Gas
  - Fluorine: 4 (can be gathered locally)

**Location**: You should be able to find an appropriate site in various wetlands (regions where Ionic Liquids are available). Look for a **flat site with copper, fluorine, ionic liquids, tetrafluorides and water**. The ionic liquids and tetrafluorides will be needed later for producing isotopic coolant, while the fluorine is necessary for producing greenhouses.

## Andraphon (He3/Be/Eu)

The only use for Europium is Microsecond Regulator, which we don't need to build if buying Aldumite Drilling Rig from vendors. Androphon can be useful as an extra Helium source. Consider visiting Procyon III to gather the copper, or buy the copper from New Atlantis vendors.

It's worth pointing out that if you land right in a Europium rich area, He3 will be extremely rare. If you land in a He3 righ area, Europium will be extremely rare. These images show the location of a site with He3, Beryllium, Aluminium, Europium and Iron.

This site is a confluence of three biomes: swamp where silver is marked on the map, savanna to the right and frozen dunes where ytterbium is marked on the map. The landing site is just inside the frozen dunes biome when approaching from the swamp side of the confluence. So follow the swap/savanna border into the frozen dunes and land on the frozen dunes side of the swamp/frozen dunes border.

The important resources from this outpost are polymer and silver for industry, and some ytterbium for weapon mods and veryl-treated manifold manufacture.

## Shoza III-a (He3, Nd)

Design:

- Landing Pad - Small
- 2 Solar Dome
- 2 Extractor - Solid (beryllium, neodymium)
- 2 Storage - Solid - Large (beryllium, neodymium)
- Extractor - Gas (he3)
- Storage - Gas - Large (he3)

- Manufactured
  - Adaptive Frame: 30
  - Tau Grade Rheostat: 4
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 61
  - Copper: 23
  - Iron: 70
  - Nickel: 4
  - Tungsten: 20

Location:

There's a little circular patch of helium-rich terrain on the edge of a region of neodymium-rich terrain. I've had luck finding helium-3, beryllium and neodymium on Shoza III-a within a few minutes of setting down (and if I don't, just reload the pre-landing save and try a new spot). I won't win any speed runs, but it's not like Leviathan II where things are almost impossible to find.

No comprehensive location guide because this planet's surface is basically craters, craters and craters so there's no confluence of biomes to guide you. Pick a site, explore for a few minutes, try to find helium and neodymium together.

If you find a nice site that lines up with the visuals on the surface map and has an easy to find location due to local features on the ground, please raise an issue in the Github project! I may end up replacing Shoza with another planet.

## Serpentis IV (fiber, structural)

This outpost is where I build my pharmaceutical lab and kitchen (see *Pharmaceuticals Lab* document). This initial setup will provide fiber and structural material to start building a habitat. A habitat here will be useful to house security detail to complement turrets and robots, all of which will be busy keeping clickbeetles at bay.

Design:

- 1 Landing Pad - Small
- 3 Wind Turbine - Advanced
- 2 Greenhouse (fiber, structural)
- 2 Extractor - Liquid (water)
- Storage - Liquid - Large (water)
- Extractor - Solid (lithium)
- 3 Storage - Solid - Large (fiber, lithium, structural)
- 2 Extractor - Gas (argon, chlorine)
- 2 Storage - Gas - Medium (argon, chlorine)

Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Adaptive Frame: 60
  - Isocentered Magnet: 6
  - Reactive Gauge: 6
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 115
  - Copper: 26
  - Iron: 91
  - Nickel: 32
  - Sealant: 6
  - Tungsten: 18
- Gas
  - Fluorine: 8

Location:

The location is one of many available along the frozen crevasses side of the frozen crevasses/savanna border and provides Lithium, Argon, Chlorine, Benzene. There's probably a better site at a confluence of frozen crevasses/savanna/wetlands which would allow copper and fluorine to be extracted, but we already have Procyon III for that and Serpentis IV is going to be busy enough producing pharmaceuticals, food, substrate molecule sieve and veryl-treated manifold (assuming you go down that path).

## Home Base Industry Expansion

With the titanium available from Tirna VIII-c, build some extra storage and production:

- Build adaptive frame, isocentered magnet, mag pressure tank, reactive gauge, tau grade rheostat, zero wire locally
- Import copper, fluorine, isotopic coolant, sealant from Procyon III
- Import beryllium from Shoza III-a
- Import polymer, silver & ytterbium from Zeta Ophiuchi I
- Import alkanes, dysprosium, tantalum, titanium and tungsten from Alpha Tirna III-c

My typical operation at this stage is to build a ship with a decent cargo capacity, then visit my outposts roughly in clockwise order around the map, returning to Bessell III-b when full to top up storage there, then Serpentis IV to top up storage there, then going through the sales route to get rid of the surplus.

This design does not include power expansion. You will need to provide 30 power, which on Bessel III-b means 5 Wind Turbine - Advanced.

Design:

- 9 Storage - Solid - Large (beryllium, copper, dysprosium, europium, neodymium, silver, titanium, tungsten, ytterbium)
- 2 Storage - Gas - Large (alkanes, fluorine)
- 7 Warehouse - Small (adaptive frame, isocentered magnet, isotopic coolant, mag pressure tank, reactive gauge, tau grade rheostat, zero wire)
- 6 Simple Fabricator (adaptive frame, isocentered magnet, mag pressure tank, reactive gauge, tau grade rheostat, zero wire)

Bill of Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Adaptive Frame: 131
  - Zero Wire: 18
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 234
  - Copper: 40
  - Iron: 180
  - Sealant: 12
  - Titanium: 35
  - Tungsten: 56

### Further Expansion

Over time, I will usually expand this storage to include space for all materials. This relies on a mixture of small storages for stuff that is imported, and large storages for the important and local resources.

## Cargo Links

For the infrastructure built so far, the vast majority of manufacturing will be done using resources found on Bessel III-b. The remaining high consumption items will be titanium and tungsten (storage and extractors), with a little copper.

For the purposes of this guide, we'll set up three sets of cargo links to bring those resources to Bessel III-b, along with the helium supply route from Androphon.

As a general rule, when laying out cargo links make sure:

1. Only one material type is shipped on any pair of cargo links
2. Material only travels one direction (out/red on one link, in/green on the other)

The way cargo links work is that the freighter will pick up whatever is in the outgoing box, fly to the other end of the link, then transfer whatever will fit from its own cargo hold to the green incoming box when it lands. Anything that doesn't fit will remain in its hold. Then when it flies back it will try to pick up what it can from the red box on the pad it's leaving. Then when it arrives back at the first pad it will dump what it can from its cargo hold into the green box, then pick up what it can from the red box as it leaves. Wash, rinse, repeat.

If you try to feed materials in both directions (eg: helium one way, copper the other), you'll eventually fill up the storage at one end of the chain and start bringing that resource back to the origin and clogging up the entire production chain.

Stick to *one material*, *one direction*.

### Bessel III-b (cargo links, helium plumbing)

Design:

- 4 Cargo Link - Inter-system
- 1 Storage - Gas - Large (helium)

Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Adaptive Frame: 10
  - Comm Relay: 4
  - Reactive Gauge: 12
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 48
  - Copper: 20
  - Iron: 80
  - Tungsten: 16

Most of these materials should already be at Bessel III-b.

When you set these cargo links up:

- plumb the *incoming* (green) bay from one cargo link to the helium storage - this will be the one we link to Androphon
- plumb the helium storage to the *helium* (blue) bay of the remaining cargo links
- connect the *incoming* (green) bays from the other three cargo links to the local storage for copper, titanium and tungsten respectively (I'm a ghostbusters fan: never cross the streams)

Here's a picture showing how I plumbed it up, the helium shipments arrive at the left-most link:

![screenshot showing four cargo links in an arc from left to right. The leftmost cargo link has its incoming bay connected to a local gas storage, for incoming helium. The helium storage is connected to the blue bays on the remaining three cargo links. There are green and grey arrows representing links from the incoming bays of the three right-most cargo links to copper, titanium and tungsten storage respectively.](images/bessel-iii-b-industry-from-scratch-4-cargo-links.jpg)


### Androphon (cargo link, helium export)

Design:

- Cargo Link - Inter-system

Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Comm Relay: 1
  - Reactive Gauge: 3
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 12
  - Iron: 20

This one is really simple: connect the helium storage at Androphon to both the outgoing/red and the helium/blue boxes on the cargo link. What this will achieve is a built-in gating of helium deliveries so that the freighter will only depart when the outgoing supply is full.

Do not activate the cargo link yet, do that from Bessel III-b once all the remote sites are built.

![screenshot showing the links between the helium production at Androphon to the local helium storage, and then separately from the storage to the cargo link's helium bay, and from the storage to the cargo link's outgoing bay](images/androphon-helium-export-to-bessel-iii-b.jpg)

### Procyon III (cargo link, copper export)

Design:

- Cargo Link - Inter-system

Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Comm Relay: 1
  - Reactive Gauge: 3
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 12
  - Iron: 20

The only connection here is sending the copper from the copper storage to the outgoing/red box on the cargo link.

### Alpha Tirna VIII-c (cargo link, titanium and tungsten export)

Design:

- Cargo Link - Inter-system

Materials:

- Manufactured
  - Comm Relay: 1
  - Reactive Gauge: 3
- Solid
  - Aluminum: 12
  - Iron: 20

The only connections here are titanium storage to the outgoing/red box of one cargo link, and tungsten storage to the outgoing/red box of the other cargo link. Here's a picture to reinforce the idea that each resource uses its own dedicated link:

![screenshot showing the links between local storage for titanium and tungsten and their respective cargo link's green bays](images/tirna-viii-c-cargo-link-connections.jpg)

### Bessel III-b (activate cargo links)

Now it's time to activate the cargo links. Double check and triple-check to make sure you have the correct materials imported to each cargo link!

When you activate a link, the first freighter to arrive will be empty. It will loiter for a short spell then depart to begin its hauling route. Each circuit takes three minutes of wall clock time (about 3 hours UT):

1. As the freighter is arriving the lights on the pad will rapidly blink amber
2. Once the freighter has landed it will transfer what cargo it can into the green bay, and the lights on the pad will slowly blink amber
3. The freighter will loiter for about a minute
4. As the freighter departs the lights on the pad will rapidly blink amber
5. Once the freighter has gone the lights on the pad will be lit steady green
6. If you launch your ship to orbit, you'll see your departing freighter in orbit and it will shortly grav jump to the destination
7. If you fast travel to the other outpost, the freighter will arrive at the destination about thirty seconds after it departed (one minute on pad at each end, thirty seconds in transit each way, total of three minutes real world time between arrivals at one end)

If the lights on the pad are red, that means you haven't configured the pad yet or it needs to be reconfigured (for example, you've broken the link by demolishing its partner).
